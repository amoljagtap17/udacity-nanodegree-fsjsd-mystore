# Full Stack JavaScript Developer Nanodegree - Mystore Ecommerce App Project

## Description

This application allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.

## Project features

The application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

- **Product list** page (_Home Nav Link_), which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities).
- **Product details** page (_Click on any Card on Home page_), which displays more information about any particular product.
- **Shopping cart** (_Cart Nav Link_), which includes the products that the user has added to their cart.
- **Checkout form** (_Cart page after adding product to cart_), which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.).
- **Order confirmation page** (_Cart page after filling in the checkout details_), which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
